#hello there

#project title: task1(Check if a Number is Even or Odd)
                task2(Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop)
#project description:     task1: in this task it required us to input a code to check if number we inserted is even or odd.
                          task2: in this task it is requested us to find the sum of integers from 1 to 50 by using the for loop.
#how to run the project:     task1: all you need to do is input any type of number you have in mind and it will detect if the number is either even or odd.
                             task2: in this task you don't have to do anything except running the code and that's it, cause the code will just show you the sum of integers from 1 to 50 and that's it.
                                                               thank you for your cooperation, and have a great day.
                                                                                     :)
